The Saturated Mutagenesis Package
**********************************

| ``saturated_mutagenesis`` is a python package, wrappped around the `pmx package <https://github.com/deGrootLab/pmx>`_, that performs mutations on proteins.
| Given a position of a residue within a protein, it mutates to all the other 19 aminoacids and subsequently, it will create the files necessary for the PELE simulations.

.. note::
   pmx is written in python 2.7
