Saturated Mutagenesis Package
==============================

| *saturated_mutagenesis* is a python package, wrappped around the `pmx package <https://github.com/deGrootLab/pmx>`_, that performs mutations on proteins.
| Given a position of a residue, it mutates to the other 19 aminoacids and will create all the files necessary for the PELE simulations.
